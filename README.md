## About Me

I'm a researcher, based at Charité Universitätsmedizin - Berlin, focused on serological modelling, immune dynamics, and vaccine evaluation. My work combines statistical inference, Bayesian methods, and epidemiological modeling to understand how populations develop and maintain immunity to infectious diseases.

## Research Interests

- **Serological Modelling**: Using antibody data to infer infection timing, transmission dynamics, and population immunity
- **Immune Dynamics & Antibody Kinetics**: Understanding how antibody levels change over time and what they tell us about protection
- **Vaccine Correlates of Protection**: Identifying immune markers that predict vaccine efficacy and can accelerate vaccine development
- **Bayesian Inference**: Applying probabilistic frameworks to extract maximum information from serological data

## Research Groups & Organizations

- **[Seroanalytics](https://seroanalytics.org)** - Collaborative research group focused on serological data analysis and methods development
