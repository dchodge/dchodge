## About Me

I'm a researcher, based at Charité Universitätsmedizin - Berlin, focused on serological modelling, immune dynamics, and vaccine evaluation.

## Research Interests

- **Serological Modelling**: Using antibody data to infer infection timing, transmission dynamics, and population immunity.
- **Immune Dynamics & Antibody Kinetics**: Understanding how antibody levels change over time and what they tell us about protection.
- **Vaccine Correlates of Protection**: Identifying immune markers that predict vaccine efficacy and can accelerate vaccine development.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Applying probabilistic frameworks to extract information from data.

## Research Groups & Organizations

- **[Seroanalytics](https://github.com/seroanalytics)** - Collaborative research group focused on serological data analysis and methods development
- **[CCGH-IDD](https://github.com/ccgh-idd)** - Centre for Global Health - Infectious Disease Dynamics
